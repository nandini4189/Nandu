*Cause:    Attempt to execute a stored procedure or use a view that has
           errors.  For stored procedures, the problem could be syntax errors
           or references to other, non-existent procedures.  For views,
           the problem could be a reference in the view's defining query to
           a non-existent table.
           Can also be a table which has references to non-existent or
           inaccessible types.
*Action:   Fix the errors and/or create referenced objects as necessary.
